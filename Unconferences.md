# What are unconferences #

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference):

> An unconference is a participant-driven meeting. The term "unconference"
> has been applied, or self-applied, to a wide range of gatherings that try
> to avoid one or more aspects of a conventional conference, such as high
> fees, sponsored presentations, and top-down organization.

Obviously there is none ;).

We encourage people to create Tryton Unconferences in their country, creating
them and spreading the word everywhere.

# Organization Application #

## Describe your organization ##

Tryton is a three-tiers high-level general purpose application platform under the license GPL-3 written in Python and using PostgreSQL as main database engine.
It is the core base of a complete business solution providing modularity, scalability and security.

## Why is your organization applying to participate in GSoC 2011? What do you hope to gain by participating? ##

We hope to end the summer with new experienced developers that will continue to be interested in our project. We are always searching for new points of view and fresh ideas for Tryton.

## Did your organization participate in past GSoCs? If so, please summarize your involvement and the successes and challenges of your participation. ##

No.

## If your organization has not previously participated in GSoC, have you applied in the past? If so, for what year(s)? ##

Yes, for 2009 and 2010.

## What license(s) does your project use? ##

GPL-3 or later

## What is the URL for your ideas page? ##

http://code.google.com/p/tryton/wiki/gsoc2011#Ideas

## What is the main development mailing list for your organization? ##

http://groups.google.com/group/tryton-dev/

## What is the main IRC channel for your organization? ##

[irc://irc.freenode.net/tryton](irc://irc.freenode.net/tryton)

## Does your organization have an application template you would like to see students use? If so, please provide it now. ##

No.

## Who will be your backup organization administrator? ##

Bertrand Chenal.

## What criteria did you use to select these individuals as mentors? Please be as specific as possible. ##

We select members that have a good knowledge of Tryton based on their contributions. Contributions can vary from writing or translating documentation to contributing code through patches or commits. Our mentors have been chosen based on their code contributions.

## What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students? ##

If we can't get in touch with a student without any sort of notice we will try to reach them via all known forms of communication (email, irc, jabber etc.). If the student does not respond to any of our attempts to contact them for 2 weeks we will send a final warning. If the student still does not respond we will consider that to be a lack of commitment and it will be noted in their evaluation. We will inform students about this policy before we start.

## What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors? ##

We have backup mentors that will follow the progress of the students. Therefore if a mentor disappears there will be other mentors that are ready to take over. Although, in a way similar to above, we will try to reach the mentor with multiple forms of communications to prevent any sort of unnecessary transition. If that mentor does disappear without notice they will be removed from our group. Our mentors will be aware of this policy before they choose to participate.

## What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program? ##

We will encourage students to use the same communication tools as the community (irc and mailing list) before, during and after the program. We will make an announcement on the mailing list introducing the students to the community. We will treat students as we would any new community members.

## What will you do to ensure that your accepted students stick with the project after GSoC concludes? ##

Overall hopefully they have such a good experience that they will want to continue to participate in the project. We will suggest new ideas so that they can continue to contribute. Additionally we will propose that they become a member of the project.

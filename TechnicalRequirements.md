# Hardware Requirements #
For running Tryton there should be no special hardware required. You can use Tryton on any computer, where the software requirements are fulfilled.

If you want to run Tryton on different computers like server and clients, we suggest for the server a higher amount of RAM, a quick harddrive and a quick network connection, typical for database server. But for single or some client use, these suggestions are not that important.
